Defining a custom pytest node type which is both an :class:`pytest.Item <Item>` and a :class:`pytest.Collector <Collector>` (e.g. :class:`pytest.File <File>`) now issues a warning.
It was never sanely supported and triggers hard to debug errors.

See :ref:`the deprecation note <diamond-inheritance-deprecated>` for full details.
